# typescript demo of node-efficientnet

This is a typescript implementation of the [node-efficientnet](https://github.com/ntedgi/node-efficientnet) project exnample code,
with promisified node calls and async-await syntax.

Note that this code will run much faster if you install the models locally. Clone from [efficientnet-tensorflowjs-binaries](https://github.com/ntedgi/efficientnet-tensorflowjs-binaries) and point `localModelRootDirectory` to the models directory.
